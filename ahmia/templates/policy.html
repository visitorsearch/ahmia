<h2>Content filtering policy</h2>

  We are removing each page which contains any child abuse from this search index.

  You can check if a hidden service is banned by visiting visitorfi5kl7q7i.onion/address/hs_id/ where hs_id is the part of the url between http:// and .onion/ (for instance, http://something.onion/ => hs_id is something).
</p>
<p>
  Also, here is a list of banned hidden services. The MD5 sum is calculated from the something.onion part (echo -e "BLAHBLAHBLAH.onion\c" | md5sum).
</p>
<p>
  If you think that a hidden service is banned wrongly, please contact us by email and tell us which hidden service is banned without a proper reason.

  The text list of the MD5 sums is available <a href="/banned/">here</a>.
